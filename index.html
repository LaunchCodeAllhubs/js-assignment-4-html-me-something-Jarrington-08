               <h2>The 80's: Super Mario Bros. 3</h2>
               <p>Super Mario Bros. 3 came out in 1988, quickly becoming one of Nintendo's most popular titles. 
                  I mean who doesn't like flying around as Racoon Mario!? <br/> (Trivia: The original name for this is Tanooki 
                  Mario in Japan based on the 
                  <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Raccoon_Mario#:~:text=Despite%20being%20localized%20as%20raccoon,with%20his%20tail%20by%20spinning.">Japanese racoon-dog</a>.)
                  Not only did the game feature tons of variety in worlds <br/> and enemies, you could always warp your way past difficult parts using those magical warp whistles!</p>

               <h2>The 90's: The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past</h2>
               <p>First released in North America in 1992 for the Super Nintendo console, Link to the Past was the smash hit follow up to the original NES games. It introduced staples of Zelda gameplay such as the Master Sword and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past">parallel worlds</a>. Which is a huge relief conisdering the Master Sword is the only way to defeat Ganon and save Hyrule!</p>

               <h2>The 2020's: Left 4 Dead</h2>
               <p>The 2000's saw the release of much more powerful 64-bit gaming consoles like the PS2 in 2000 and later, the Xbox 360, in 2005. These game platforms provided the computing power to build larger and more complex games. Left 4 Dead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead">used AI</a> to make each play through of the game unique as you fight off hundreds of infected with everything from baseball bats to chainsaws!</p>
